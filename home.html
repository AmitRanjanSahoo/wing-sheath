				<h3><b><u>Title:Temporal Oscillation Theory: A Superposition-Based Explanation of the Universe's Origin</u></b></h3><br>

  Abstract:  
Temporal Oscillation Theory proposes that all entities in the universe—including space, mass, energy, and consciousness—exist in simultaneous superposition across the dimensions of past, present, and future. Rather than perceiving time as a linear flow, this framework treats time as an oscillating, multidirectional field. This theory suggests that what we observe as the "Big Bang" was not the beginning of the universe but a phase-state condensation of infinite potentials into a perceivable frame. This model reinterprets fundamental concepts such as mass, space, and entropy and offers a unified platform for understanding time travel, memory, energy flow, and quantum superposition.

  Core Premises:  
  <br>
1.   Time Superposition:  
   Every point in time (past, present, future) exists simultaneously. Consciousness moves or aligns with a specific time-frame, collapsing a perception of "now."
   <br>
2.   Energy Flow Determines Perception:  
   Reverse or forward flow of energy in the field determines which time state the observer is aligned with.
   <br>
3.   Space and Mass Are Observer-Relative:  
   Mass and space are not fixed quantities but emergent properties that appear stable due to time alignment.
   <br>
4.   The Big Bang as a Temporal Condensation:  
   The Big Bang was not a point-origin event but a condensation of superposed time-fields into a low-entropy perceivable state.
   <br>
5.   Tagless Fields and Markers:  
   By identifying or creating markers unaffected by time, one could navigate or observe other time states directly.

---
<br>
  Applications and Predictions:  <br>

1.   Time Travel:  
   Navigating between time states is theoretically possible by manipulating the energy flow alignment and anchoring to invariant markers.
   <br>
2.   Storage in Void:  
   Empty space can hold matter or data in dormant time states, allowing creation of dimensional storage ("pocket space").
   <br>
3.   New View on Entropy:  
   Entropy may not always increase but instead shifts depending on the dominant time-state flow.
   <br>
4.   Perception Creates Reality:  
   Observation doesn’t just collapse wavefunctions but also stabilizes the illusion of fixed space and mass.
   <br>
5.   No Absolute Measurement:  
   All measurements (length, volume, mass) are temporarily stabilized perceptions of oscillating potential fields.

<br>
  Further Implications:  
  <br>
  The universe may be infinitely large or small simultaneously.
  Matter duplication, quantum entanglement, and dark energy could be expressions of temporal interference.
  Memory and consciousness are the internal evidences of our own oscillations between time states.
  <br>
---

  Next Steps:  
  <br>
  Construct mathematical formulations based on field interference patterns.
  Search for possible time-invariant markers (possibly via deep space or quantum behavior).
  Simulate oscillating consciousness models to explain déjà vu and precognition.
  Collaborate with quantum physicists and cosmologists to integrate with existing models like M-theory or loop quantum gravity.
